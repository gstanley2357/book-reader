prompt: Generate a document reader application. book-reader-ui.png has the user interface I want.
The main central pane:
  This is where the document I'm reading is shown.
  Documents can be text, pdf, or a web page.
  There needs to be controls for navigating through the document.
  The text is selectable.
The left outline pane:
  This contains an outline or table of contents for the document.
  It also has a master list of all of the definitions.
  When a node or definition is clicked, the document will scroll to that location.
The right pane:
  This contains the data for the selected text.
  That data includes:
    A list of definitions of the selected text. Definitions also have a context connected with them.
    Links to web pages or files that serve as references for the selected text.
    Notes that are attached to the selected text.
    The type of the selected text. Examples are source code, programming term, identifier, operator.
    The location and range of the selected text.
Actions:
  Select text.
  Add, delete, or change a definition.
  Change the definition context.
  Add a new document to the database.
  Add, delete, or change a link.
  Add, delete, or change a note.
  Change the type of the selected text.
  Create a synonym for the selected text.
  The document's text is highlighted if it can be found in the database.
The selected text is the main object of the system. It is unique in the database. When a definition, link, location or other
data is attached to the selected text, it is to that unique data. Selected text can be one word or symbol or it can be multiple words.
Selected text can have synonyms. In that case, attached data is shared between all the synonyms.
The application should be written in ruby on rails. Data should be stored in a sqlite database.

Please generate the basic application framework, but do not implement operational details. Instead, create a task list with
implementation steps as fine-grained as possible (baby steps).
response: I've created a comprehensive Ruby on Rails document reader application framework along with an extremely detailed implementation task list. Here's what I've provided:

## Application Framework Features:

1. **Complete MVC Structure**:
   - 8 models with proper associations and validations
   - Controllers for all CRUD operations
   - RESTful routes with nested resources
   - API endpoints for AJAX operations

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Documents table for storing various document types
   - Document outlines for table of contents
   - Selected texts as the core unique entities
   - Definitions, links, notes, and synonyms attached to selected texts
   - Document locations for tracking text positions

3. **Three-Pane UI Structure**:
   - Left pane: Document outline and master definitions list
   - Center pane: Document content with navigation controls
   - Right pane: Selected text details and management

4. **Key Features Included**:
   - Text selection and highlighting system
   - Definition, link, and note management
   - Synonym support with shared data
   - Document navigation and zoom controls
   - AJAX-driven interactions

## Implementation Task List:

The task list is organized into 15 phases with 200+ granular tasks covering:

- **Infrastructure**: Rails setup, database migrations, basic MVC
- **Core Features**: Document processing, text selection, outline generation
- **Advanced Features**: Highlighting, search, export/import
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, security, performance optimization
- **Deployment**: Documentation, deployment, post-launch support

Each task is designed to be a "baby step" that can be completed in a few hours to a day, making the project manageable and allowing for incremental progress tracking.

The estimated timeline is 16-25 weeks depending on scope and team size, with built-in risk mitigation strategies and quality standards.

This framework provides a solid foundation for building the document reader application exactly as described in your requirements, with the flexibility to add more advanced features as needed.

Sprockets::Railtie::ManifestNeededError: Expected to find a manifest file in `app/assets/config/manifest.js` (Sprockets::Railtie::ManifestNeededError)
But did not, please create this file and use it to link any assets that need
to be rendered by your app:

Example:
  //= link_tree ../images
  //= link_directory ../javascripts .js
  //= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
and restart your server
response: This error occurs when Rails can't find the Sprockets manifest file that tells the asset pipeline which files to compile and serve. Here's how to fix it:

## Quick Fix

Create the missing manifest file:

```bash
mkdir -p app/assets/config
touch app/assets/config/manifest.js
```

Then add the basic manifest content:

```javascript
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
```

## Common Causes

This typically happens when:
- You're upgrading from an older Rails version
- The manifest file was accidentally deleted
- You're working with a Rails app that wasn't properly initialized

## Complete Solution

1. **Create the manifest file** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   touch app/assets/config/manifest.js
   ```

2. **Add appropriate directives** based on your asset structure:
   ```javascript
   //= link_tree ../images
   //= link_directory ../javascripts .js
   //= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
   //= link application.css
   //= link application.js
   ```

3. **Adjust for your specific setup**. If you have:
   - SCSS files: `//= link_directory ../stylesheets .scss`
   - CoffeeScript: `//= link_directory ../javascripts .coffee`
   - Specific files: `//= link your_file.css`

4. **Restart your Rails server**:
   ```bash
   bin/rails server
   ```

## Alternative: Application Layout

If you prefer, you can also ensure your assets are properly linked in your application layout (`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`):

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', 'data-turbo-track': 'reload' %>
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
```

The manifest file is the recommended approach as it gives Sprockets explicit instructions about which assets to compile and serve.

prompt: How do I set up basic application layout structure in a new rails project?
response: Here's how to set up a solid application layout structure in a new Rails project:

## 1. Create the Basic Application Layout

First, ensure you have a proper application layout at `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your App Name</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>
    
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
    <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <header>
      <%= render 'shared/navbar' %>
    </header>

    <main>
      <% if notice %>
        <div class="notice"><%= notice %></div>
      <% end %>
      
      <% if alert %>
        <div class="alert"><%= alert %></div>
      <% end %>

      <%= yield %>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <%= render 'shared/footer' %>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Create Shared Partials Directory

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/shared
```

Create a navbar partial at `app/views/shared/_navbar.html.erb`:

```erb
<nav class="navbar">
  <%= link_to "Home", root_path, class: "navbar-brand" %>
  
  <div class="navbar-nav">
    <%= link_to "About", about_path, class: "nav-link" %>
    <%= link_to "Contact", contact_path, class: "nav-link" %>
  </div>
</nav>
```

Create a footer partial at `app/views/shared/_footer.html.erb`:

```erb
<footer class="footer">
  <div class="container">
    <p>&copy; <%= Date.current.year %> Your App Name. All rights reserved.</p>
  </div>
</footer>
```

## 3. Set Up Basic Stylesheets

Create `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```css
/*
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 */

/* Reset and base styles */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
}

/* Layout */
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 20px;
}

/* Navigation */
.navbar {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  padding: 1rem 0;
}

.navbar-brand {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #333;
}

.navbar-nav {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.nav-link {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #666;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.nav-link:hover {
  color: #333;
}

/* Main content */
main {
  min-height: calc(100vh - 120px);
  padding: 2rem 0;
}

/* Flash messages */
.notice, .alert {
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.notice {
  background-color: #d4edda;
  color: #155724;
  border: 1px solid #c3e6cb;
}

.alert {
  background-color: #f8d7da;
  color: #721c24;
  border: 1px solid #f5c6cb;
}

/* Footer */
.footer {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border-top: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  margin-top: auto;
}
```

## 4. Create Component-Specific Stylesheets

Create organized stylesheets for different components:

```bash
touch app/assets/stylesheets/components.css
touch app/assets/stylesheets/forms.css
touch app/assets/stylesheets/buttons.css
```

Example `app/assets/stylesheets/forms.css`:

```css
/* Form styles */
.form-group {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.form-label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.form-control {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 1rem;
}

.form-control:focus {
  outline: none;
  border-color: #007bff;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.25);
}

.btn {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 1rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

.btn-primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

## 5. Set Up Asset Pipeline

Ensure your `app/assets/config/manifest.js` includes:

```javascript
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
//= link application.css
//= link application.js
```

## 6. Create a Home Controller and View

Generate a home controller:

```bash
rails generate controller Home index
```

Set up your routes in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'home#index'
  get 'about', to: 'pages#about'
  get 'contact', to: 'pages#contact'
end
```

## 7. Create a Simple Home Page

Update `app/views/home/index.html.erb`:

```erb
<div class="container">
  <div class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to Your App</h1>
    <p>This is your new Rails application with a clean, organized layout structure.</p>
    <%= link_to "Get Started", "#", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 8. Add Hero Section Styles

Add to your `application.css`:

```css
.hero {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 4rem 0;
}

.hero h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  color: #333;
}

.hero p {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
  color: #666;
}
```

This structure gives you a solid foundation with:
- Organized layout with header, main content, and footer
- Reusable partials for navigation and footer
- Clean, organized CSS structure
- Flash message handling
- Responsive design basics
- Proper asset pipeline setup

You can expand on this by adding more components, integrating a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, or adding JavaScript functionality as needed.
