Generate a document reader application. book-reader-ui.png has the user interface I want.
The main central pane:
  This is where the document I'm reading is shown.
  Documents can be text, pdf, or from a web page.
  There needs to be controls for navigating through the document.
  The text is selectable.
The left outline pane:
  This contains an outline or table of contents for the document.
  It also has a master list of all of the definitions.
  When a node or definition is clicked, the document will scroll to that location.
The right pane:
  This contains the data for the selected text.
  That data includes:
    A list of definitions of the selected text. Definitions also have a context connected with them.
    Links to web pages or files that serve as references for the selected text.
    Notes that are attached to the selected text.
    The type of the selected text. Examples are source code, programming term, identifier, operator.
    The location and range of the selected text.
Actions:
  Select text.
  Add, delete, or change a definition.
  Change the definition context.
  Add a new document to the database.
  Add, delete, or change a link.
  Add, delete, or change a note.
  Change the type of the selected text.
  Create a synonym for the selected text.
  The document's text is highlighted if it can be found in the database.
The selected text is the main object of the system. It is unique in the database. When a definition, link, location or other
data is attached to the selected text, it is to that unique data. Selected text can be one word or symbol or it can be multiple words.
Selected text can have synonyms. In that case, attached data is shared between all the synonyms.
The application should be written in python3. Data should be stored in a sqlite database. Please choose an appropriate application
framework.
